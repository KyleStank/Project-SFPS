# Project SFPS
## Any contribution is helpful
Project SFPS (Simple First Person Shooter) is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) video game made with the Unity3D game engine. This game is currently a W.I.P. (Work in Progress) being made purely for fun. Any contribution would 
be greatly appreciated, and you may contribute by forking the main repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.

## A Necessary Evil
Since Project SFPS is completely free, and is being made with a development budget of $0, some annoying limits have been imposed. There can only be 3 instances of the game running at one time. 
After reading that, you may be seriously fucking pissed, just like I am every day. Now, you may why this is happening. Well the answer is simple: Unity's shitty UNET service only allows 20 users to connect to 
their network at once for free. This is because it costs them money to host servers, and they don't do anything out of the kindness of their hearts, and since each game can allow 6 players, and
6 * 3 is 18. Only 3 games can be made at once. The reason I can't allow more games is because I am not getting any sort of money for this, so I simply do not have enough money to 
to pay a monthly fee for their mulitplayer services. I hate this just as much as you, but it is a necessary evil.

## Conclusion
Fortunately I am not planning to advertise this game a whole lot. If I'm lucky then that won't be a problem, but if I'm unlucky, and people actually play this game, well then 
I have a shit storm ahead of me.

Programmers are encouraged to contribute.
