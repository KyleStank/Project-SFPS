# Project SFPS
## Any contribution is helpful
Project SFPS(Simple First Person Shooter) is a free and open source video game made with Unity3D. This game is currently a W.I.P., and is being made for fun. Any contribution would 
be very appreciated, and you can contribute however you want, so start today!

## A necessary evil
Since Project SFPS is completely free, and is being made with a development fund of $0, there are some very annoying and outrageous limits. There can only be 3 games going on at once. 
After reading that, you may be blazing pissed, just like I am every day. Now, "Why is this??", you may ask. Well the answer is simple: Unity's UNET service only allows 20 user's to connect to 
their network at once for free. This is because it costs them money to host servers, and they don't do anything out of the kindness of their hearts. So, since each game can allow 6 players, 
6 * 3 is 18, which means only 3 games can be made at once. The reason I can't allow more games, is because I am not getting any sort of money for this, so I simply do not have enough money to 
to pay a monthly fee for their mulitplayer services. I hate this just as much as you, but it is a necessary evil.

## Conclusion
The good news, is that I am not going to advertise this game a whole lot, so if I am really lucky, that won't be a problem. If I am unlucky, and people actually play this game, well then 
I have a shit storm ahead of me.

Anyways, thank you for reading this, and please, contribute to Project SFPS now! Thank you!
