# FPSGame
Open source video game made with Unity3D. This is a simple multiplayer FPS game. Right now, the game is in VERY early development, not even close to a Pre-Alpha. Any contribution will be highly appriciated. If you are a 3D modeler, create some models. If you are a level designer, create a level.

Right now, any network programmers and sound artists would be great to have, as those are two areas where I lack a lot. To make a contribution, simply create a Pull Request, and make sure to include all of the main changes that you have made to the project.
